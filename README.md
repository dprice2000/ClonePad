Challenge Project 6 from 100 days of Swift

This is my solution to challenge project 6 for 100 Days Of Swift from hackingwithswift.com
The challenge is to create a simple clone of the notes app
This is a basic note taking app that allows you to select a note from a table view and edit it in a
text view.  Users can save and delete notes.  Notes are sorted by most recently editied.
